# Arabic Dialect Identification  

Automatic recognition and classification of **Arabic dialects** using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques. This project explores the challenges of linguistic diversity in Arabic and provides solutions through data analysis, text representation, and model training.  

---

## üìå Overview  
Arabic is a highly diverse language with many dialects, making automatic dialect identification a challenging problem in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
This project applies both **classical ML methods** and **deep learning models** to classify dialects accurately.  

---

## üìÇ Datasets  
We used two major publicly available datasets:  
- **MADAR**: A dataset for fine-grained Arabic dialect identification across multiple cities.  
- **QADI**: A dataset covering various Arabic dialects with labeled samples.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  
1. **Data Analysis**  
   - Explored dataset distributions and characteristics of different dialects.  
   - Preprocessing steps: tokenization, normalization, and cleaning.  

2. **Baseline Model**  
   - TF-IDF vectorization + Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (benchmark performance).  

3. **Deep Learning Models**  
   - Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs).  
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for text classification.  
   - Semantic text representation to improve understanding of dialectal variations.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Models were compared using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **NLP Tools:** TF-IDF, Embeddings, Text Preprocessing  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## üìä Results  
- Baseline TF-IDF + Multinomial NB provided a solid starting point.  
- Deep learning models (CNN, FCNN) achieved improved accuracy and captured more semantic nuances.  
- Semantic representation further enhanced classification performance.

## üöÄ Future Work  
- Experiment with **transformer-based models** (BERT, AraBERT, LLaMA) for improved results.  
- Expand dataset coverage across more dialects.  
- Deploy the trained model as a **web API** for real-world applications.
